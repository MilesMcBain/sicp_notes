# Generic operations with explicit dispatch

A function contains within it the handling of all types supported by the operation.

- all operations on new types must be added to that one function, code is not modular, you get all or nothing.

# Data directed style

A generic dispatcher looks up a type specific implementation in a registry. Can perform lookup using more than one type for "multiple-dispatch".

+ Implementations for new types need only be introduced intro the registry. Code is modular and types/implementations can be introduced into the program as necessary.

There isn't much difference between implementing a new operation or a new type:
Write a bunch of functions and add them to the registry with the appropriate
keys. Modules can provide operations for types in other modules.

# Message passing style

An "intelligent data object" contains the specific implementations for its'
type, alongside the data. This can be dispatched by passing the object a message
i.e. the name of the operation to be performed.

Implementing a new type is a bit simpler than implementing a new
operation. All the operations are encapsulated within the type. A new operation
across many types is a challenge to modularity, since it involves changing the
dispatch control-flow in many types.

It's hard for modules to provide new operations for types in other modules. They
can sub-class them, and then potentially rely on polymorphism to allow the two
classes to be used interchangeably. Complexity increases!

# Systems where types are added frequently

If you have to use message passing, this is probably the type of system where it shines. However, it's hardly more effort to create types with data-directed style, which has the benefit of being more modular.

# Systems where operations are added frequently

In a data directed system, operations can be added easily with next to no impact on existing code. The are also completely modular.
