Within the generic dispatch table there are no entries for `real-part`, `imag-part`, `magnitude`, and `angle` for type tag `complex`.

Entries do exist for these for `polar` and `rectanglar`, coming from the packages developed earlier.

So the call:

`(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)`

Creates a new entry that calls the existing generic `magnitude` from on the contents of complex, when `(magnitude <some complex>)` is called.

The implementation of `magnitude` looks something like this:

```scheme
(define (magnitude arg)
  (apply-generic 'magnitude arg))
```

`apply-generic` uses the type tag from `arg` to get the procedure to call on it's value: `((get 'magnitude (tag arg) (value arg))'`

In the case where `magnitude` is called on a `complex` the procedure `get` will extract from the registry is the same generic `magnitude` method that was called on the `complex`. It will be called again on the value of complex which will also be tagged data, either `polar` or `rectangular`

The call stack might look something like this:
  - (magnitude z)
  - (apply-generic 'magnitude z)
  - (get 'magnitude 'complex)
  - (magnitude z_unwrapped)
  - (apply-generic 'magnitude z_unwrapped)
  - (get 'magnitude 'polar)
  - (magnitude-polar z_unwrapped_unwrapped)

With `apply-generic` being called twice.
