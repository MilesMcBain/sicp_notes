;; Give O(n) implementations of union-set and intersection-set

;; Use ordered intersection-set from p209 and union-set from ex2.62. Each of these is O(n)

;; Update these such that the first step is to copy both trees to lists O(n) + O(n)
;; The second step is to do the intersection or union O(n)
;; The third step is to turn result into a balanced tree O(n)
;; A series of 4 O(n) operations is still O(n).
